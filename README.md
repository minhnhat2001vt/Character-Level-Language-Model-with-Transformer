# Character-Level Language Model with Transformer Architecture (Nano GPT)

## Project Overview:
This project implements a **character-level language model** using a **Transformer** architecture. The goal of the model is to learn the patterns and structure of text data (in this case, Shakespeare's works) and generate new text in a similar style. The model processes sequences of characters, predicts the next character in the sequence, and is trained using a large corpus of text data.

## Key Features:
1. **Transformer Architecture**: The model is built using multiple Transformer blocks, each containing a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward network. The model leverages the attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies in the sequence, making it more powerful than traditional RNN-based models for text generation.

2. **Character Embedding**: Instead of working with words, the model operates at the character level. Characters are mapped to unique integers using an embedding table. This allows the model to predict the next character based on the context of previous characters.

3. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The multi-head self-attention mechanism enables the model to focus on different parts of the sequence while making predictions, allowing it to better understand the relationships between characters.

4. **Text Generation**: Once trained, the model can generate new text by sampling from the learned probability distribution over characters. The text is generated one character at a time, conditioned on the context of previously generated characters.

5. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained using cross-entropy loss, where it learns to predict the next character in the sequence. The training process includes evaluation on both training and validation sets to monitor performance and avoid overfitting.

## Key Components:
- **Data Loading**: The Shakespeare text is preprocessed by encoding each character as an integer. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- **Batch Processing**: The model processes data in batches. Each batch contains sequences of characters and their corresponding targets (next character in the sequence).
- **Transformer Blocks**: Each block consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward network. Layer normalization and residual connections are used to stabilize training.
- **Text Generation**: After training, the model can generate coherent text by sampling from the predicted character distributions, producing creative and plausible text sequences in a Shakespearean style.

## Technologies Used:
- **PyTorch**: A popular deep learning framework used to build and train the Transformer model.
- **Transformer Architecture**: A modern neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: A key component of the Transformer architecture that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence while making predictions.

## Applications:
This project showcases how a Transformer model can be applied to text generation tasks. It can be extended to:
- Generate text in different writing styles or based on various types of text corpora.
- Be adapted for larger language models to generate entire paragraphs, stories, or scripts.
- Serve as a foundation for more complex models in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, or text summarization.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to implement and train a character-level language model using the powerful Transformer architecture, making it capable of generating creative, coherent text based on learned patterns from a given corpus.
